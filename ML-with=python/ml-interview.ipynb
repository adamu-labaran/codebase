    "The hunt for missing values\n",
    "Questions about processing missing values are integral to any machine learning interview. If you are provided with a dataset with missing values, not addressing them will likely skew your results and lower your model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll practice the first pre-processing step by finding and exploring ways to handle missing values using pandas and numpy on a customer loan dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, which you'll use for many of the exercises in this course, is saved to your workspace as loan_data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you are in the pipeline:\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "Great! It sounds like you’re diving into missing value handling in a customer loan dataset. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you with this process using pandas and numpy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the Dataset\n",
    "First, make sure to load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame if you haven’t already:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset\n",
    "loan_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset/loan_data.csv')\n",
    "2. Check for Missing Values\n",
    "You can quickly get an overview of missing values in your dataset using isna() or isnull() combined with sum():\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Check for missing values in each column\n",
    "missing_values = loan_data.isna().sum()\n",
    "print(missing_values)\n",
    "3. Explore the Missing Data\n",
    "To better understand the missing data, you can visualize it using heatmaps with seaborn:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot a heatmap of missing values\n",
    "sns.heatmap(loan_data.isna(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "4. Handle Missing Values\n",
    "Here are several common methods for dealing with missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Remove Missing Values\n",
    "You can remove rows or columns with missing values if they are not critical:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Remove rows with missing values\n",
    "loan_data_cleaned_rows = loan_data.dropna()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove columns with missing values\n",
    "loan_data_cleaned_cols = loan_data.dropna(axis=1)\n",
    "b. Fill Missing Values\n",
    "You might choose to fill missing values with a specific value, such as the mean, median, or mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Fill missing values with the mean (for numerical columns)\n",
    "loan_data_filled_mean = loan_data.fillna(loan_data.mean())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fill missing values with the median (for numerical columns)\n",
    "loan_data_filled_median = loan_data.fillna(loan_data.median())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fill missing values with a specific value (e.g., 0)\n",
    "loan_data_filled_value = loan_data.fillna(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# For categorical columns, you can use the mode\n",
    "loan_data_filled_mode = loan_data.fillna(loan_data.mode().iloc[0])\n",
    "c. Interpolation\n",
    "For time-series data or ordered data, interpolation might be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Interpolate missing values\n",
    "loan_data_interpolated = loan_data.interpolate()\n",
    "5. Verify the Changes\n",
    "After handling missing values, verify that there are no more missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Check for missing values again\n",
    "missing_values_after = loan_data.isna().sum()\n",
    "print(missing_values_after)\n",
    "6. Proceed with Further Analysis\n",
    "With missing values handled, you can move forward with your analysis or model building.\n",
