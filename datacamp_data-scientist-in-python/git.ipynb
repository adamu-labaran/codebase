    "introduction to git\n",
    "\n",
    "what is git\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It helps manage and track changes to files, typically used for source code management in software development. Here are some key concepts and features of Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "Repository (Repo): A repository is a storage location where your project's files and their revision history are stored. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server).\n",
    "\n",
    "Commit: A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It includes a message describing the changes made. Commits form a history of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branch: A branch is a parallel version of the repository. It allows you to work on different features or fixes independently. The main branch is often called master or main.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge: Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. It combines the work done on different branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone: Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a remote repository on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull: Pulling is the process of fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Push: Pushing is the process of sending your local changes to a remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote: A remote is a version of your repository that is hosted on the internet or network. Examples include repositories on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflict: A conflict occurs when changes from different branches cannot be automatically merged. Conflicts must be resolved manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staging Area: The staging area is a place where you can group changes before committing them. This allows you to prepare and review changes before they become a part of the commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git Commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "git init: Initializes a new Git repository.\n",
    "git clone: Clones an existing repository.\n",
    "git add: Adds changes to the staging area.\n",
    "git commit: Records changes to the repository.\n",
    "git status: Shows the status of changes.\n",
    "git push: Pushes changes to a remote repository.\n",
    "git pull: Pulls changes from a remote repository.\n",
    "git branch: Manages branches.\n",
    "git merge: Merges branches.\n",
    "git log: Shows commit history.\n",
    "Git is widely used because it allows for efficient collaboration, maintains a detailed history of changes, and supports branching and merging, which facilitates parallel development and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the shell\n",
    "Git commands are typically performed using the Shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding some common shell commands allows you to perform more of your Git workflow in the shell without having to spend time navigating different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will practice some of these commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find out how many files and directories are in the data directory.\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "To find out how many files and directories are in a directory using the shell, you can use the ls command in combination with wc (word count). Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the data directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "cd path/to/data\n",
    "Replace path/to/data with the actual path to your data directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Count the files and directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "ls -1 | wc -l\n",
    "ls -1: Lists all files and directories, one per line.\n",
    "wc -l: Counts the number of lines output by ls, which corresponds to the number of files and directories.\n",
    "This command will output the total number of files and directories in the data directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking the version of Git\n",
    "Just like you need to know what version of a file you are working with, it's important to understand which version of Git is installed on your computer so you're aware of what functionality it offers.\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "To check the version of Git installed on your computer, you can use the following command in the shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git --version\n",
    "This command will output the version of Git currently installed. For example, the output might look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git version 2.32.0\n",
    "This tells you that Git version 2.32.0 is installed on your computer. Knowing the version can help you understand what features are available and ensure compatibility with other tools and workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a file\n",
    "For the remainder of the course, you will be working on a Git project analyzing the mental health of employees working at tech companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will complete a version control workflow to save an updated copy of mental_health_survey.csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are located in mh_survey/data, which contains the csv file that has been recently edited.\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "To complete a version control workflow and save the updated copy of the mental_health_survey.csv file using Git, you will need to follow these steps in the shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the mh_survey/data directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "cd path/to/mh_survey/data\n",
    "Replace path/to/mh_survey/data with the actual path if you're not already in the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized):\n",
    "If you haven't initialized a Git repository in the project directory yet, you can do so by navigating to the root of your project (not inside the data directory) and running:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "cd ..\n",
    "cd ..\n",
    "git init\n",
    "This step is only necessary if the repository hasn't been initialized before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the updated CSV file to the staging area:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git add mental_health_survey.csv\n",
    "Commit the changes with a descriptive message:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git commit -m \"Update mental_health_survey.csv with recent edits\"\n",
    "(Optional) Push the changes to a remote repository:\n",
    "If you have a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), you can push your changes using:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git remote add origin <remote-repository-URL>\n",
    "git branch -M main\n",
    "git push -u origin main\n",
    "Replace <remote-repository-URL> with the URL of your remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the complete workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "cd path/to/mh_survey/data\n",
    "git add mental_health_survey.csv\n",
    "git commit -m \"Update mental_health_survey.csv with recent edits\"\n",
    "If pushing to a remote repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git remote add origin <remote-repository-URL>\n",
    "git branch -M main\n",
    "git push -u origin main\n",
    "These commands ensure that your updated file is tracked by Git, the changes are committed to the repository, and optionally pushed to a remote repository for backup and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding multiple files\n",
    "You've added one more task to the report.md and an extra row of participant data tomental_health_survey.csv files:\n",
    "\n",
    "report.md:\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Add data visualizations.\n",
    "mental_health_survey.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "49,M,No,Yes,Never,Yes,Yes,No\n",
    "You need to figure out which files are in the repo, and which are in the staging area, so you can update everything.\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "To add multiple files and commit them to the Git repository, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the status of your repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git status\n",
    "This command will show you which files are modified, which are in the staging area, and which are untracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the updated files to the staging area:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git add report.md mental_health_survey.csv\n",
    "Commit the changes with a descriptive message:\n",
    "\n",
    "sh\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git commit -m \"Update report.md with new task and add new participant data to mental_health_survey.csv\"\n",
    "Here's the complete workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "git status\n",
    "git add report.md mental_health_survey.csv\n",
    "git commit -m \"Update report.md with new task and add new participant data to mental_health_survey.csv\"\n",
    "This will add both report.md and mental_health_survey.csv to the staging area and commit the changes to the repository. The git status command before adding the files helps you confirm which files are modified and whether they are already staged or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "git status is a great way to see where you are in the version control workflow, allowing you to take steps to ensure everything is up-to-date. The commit output shows that two files were changed!\n",

    "git clean -n  and git clean -f\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "git clean -n: This command lists all the untracked files in your working directory. It's a safe way to preview which files will be deleted by git clean -f before actually removing them. It prevents accidental deletion of important files.\n",
    "\n",
    "git clean -f: After you've confirmed using git clean -n that the files you want to remove are indeed untracked, you can use this command to permanently delete them from your working directory. Be cautious with this command, as it cannot be undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of other options:\n",
    "\n",
    "git reset HEAD: This command resets the staging area to match the HEAD commit (the latest commit in your current branch). It won't affect untracked files.\n",
    "git clean alone: Without the -n flag, git clean defaults to deleting untracked files directly. However, it's generally recommended to use -n first to double-check which files will be removed.\n",
    "By following these steps, you can safely identify and remove unwanted untracked files from your Git repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the output of git log -2 report.md, find the commit hash associated with the commit message \"Added summary report file\". This hash is a unique identifier for that specific commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Restoring the File Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use git checkout <commit_hash> report.md to replace the current version of report.md in your working directory with the version from the specified commit. Replace <commit_hash> with the actual hash you identified in step 2.\n",

    "4. Staging the Restored File (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to include the restored version of report.md in the next commit, you'll need to stage it using git add report.md. This tells Git that you want to track the changes made by restoring the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Committing the Changes (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "If you staged the restored file, create a new commit to record the change. Use git commit -m \"Restoring version from commit <commit_hash>\". Replace <commit_hash> with the actual hash again. The message \"Restoring version from commit <commit_hash>\" clearly describes the purpose of the commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using git checkout <commit_hash> report.md only replaces the file in your working directory. It doesn't modify the Git history itself.\n",
    "If you don't stage the restored file (git add report.md), the changes won't be part of the next commit.\n",
