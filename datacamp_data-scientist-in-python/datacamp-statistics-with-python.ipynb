    "The correct answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine displays all the behavior that you'd expect from a full-fledged person.\n",
    "Strong AI, also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), refers to a machine that can understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks, essentially matching or surpassing human cognitive abilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "The correct answer is likely:\n",
    "\n",
    "human-created content\n",
    "AI is often judged by its ability to generate or replicate human-like creativity and content, making it impressive when it can create art, music, text, and other forms of content that are traditionally created by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3\n",
    "You ask your ChatGPT system, \"What is it like to be in love?\" The generative AI system goes on to explain feelings of connection and romance. How do these systems understand such a complex human emotion?\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "As of right now, they don't. The system is just compiling other authors' views on love.\n",
    "Current AI systems, including ChatGPT, do not have the capability to understand or experience human emotions. They generate responses based on patterns learned from vast amounts of text data, essentially synthesizing and mimicking human-like descriptions without any true emotional comprehension.\n",
