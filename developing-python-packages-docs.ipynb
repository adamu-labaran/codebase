    "core.py Writing function documentation with pyment II Documentation helps your users learn how to use your functions, and can even help remind you how to use them. In this exercise, you'll fill out your NumPy style documentation template to make some beautiful documentation. In the text editor, complete the documentation for the inches_to_feet() function. The short description for this function should read \"Convert lengths between inches and feet.\" Complete the x parameter documentation with type numpy.ndarray and description \"Lengths in feet.\" Complete the reverse parameter documentation with type bool, optional and the description \"If true this function converts from feet to inches instead of the default behavior of inches to feet. (Default value = False)\". Set the return type to numpy.ndarray.
