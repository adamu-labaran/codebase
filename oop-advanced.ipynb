    "OOP termininology\n",
    "That was a lot of terminology at once -- classes, objects, methods, attributes… Before you start writing your own object-oriented code, make sure you have a solid grasp on the main concepts of OOP.\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolves around the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of \"classes.\" Understanding the key terminology is crucial before diving into writing OOP code. Here's a breakdown of the main concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class\n",
    "Definition: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "Analogy: Think of a class as a blueprint for a house. It doesn’t represent an actual house but rather the design for one.\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    "Definition: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity based on the blueprint provided by the class.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "my_car = Car()\n",
    "Analogy: If the class is a blueprint, then the object is the actual house built from that blueprint.\n",
    "3. Method\n",
    "Definition: A method is a function defined within a class that describes the behaviors of the objects created from the class.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The car is driving\")\n",
    "Analogy: If your object is a car, methods would be actions like \"drive\" or \"stop\" that the car can perform.\n",
    "4. Attribute\n",
    "Definition: An attribute is a variable that holds data specific to an object. Attributes are defined within a class and are associated with objects.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, brand):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "Analogy: Attributes are like the properties of a house, such as the color of the walls or the number of rooms.\n",
    "5. Encapsulation\n",
    "Definition: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting access to some of the object’s components to protect the integrity of the data.\n",
    "Example: Using private attributes (e.g., self.__speed) that can only be accessed within the class.\n",
    "Analogy: Encapsulation is like keeping the wiring and plumbing of a house hidden behind walls, protecting it from outside interference.\n",
    "6. Inheritance\n",
    "Definition: Inheritance allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class, enabling code reusability.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class ElectricCar(Car):\n",
    "    def charge(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The car is charging\")\n",
    "Analogy: Think of inheritance like a child inheriting features from their parents.\n",
    "7. Polymorphism\n",
    "Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also refers to the ability to redefine methods in derived classes.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def start(vehicle):\n",
    "    vehicle.drive()\n",
    "Here, vehicle could be an instance of Car, Bike, or any other class that implements the drive method.\n",
    "Analogy: Polymorphism is like having a universal remote control that can work with different devices (TV, stereo, etc.).\n",
    "8. Abstraction\n",
    "Definition: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "Analogy: Abstraction is like using a smartphone without needing to understand its internal circuitry.\n",
    "These concepts are the foundation of OOP, and understanding them will help you structure your code in a more organized, reusable, and maintainable way.\n",

    "To determine the class of the mystery object, you can use the type() function. Here’s how you can explore the object:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Use type() to Find the Class\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "type(mystery)\n",
    "This will tell you the class to which the mystery object belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Use dir() to List Attributes and Methods\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "dir(mystery)\n",
    "This will list all the attributes and methods available for the mystery object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Use help() for Detailed Documentation\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "help(mystery)\n",
    "This will provide the documentation for the class, including details on methods and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering the Question\n",
    "After running type(mystery), it will return the class of the object. Based on that, you can choose the correct answer from the options provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the output of type(mystery) is something like __main__.Employee, then the correct answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "__main__.Employee\n",
    "If you have already executed this code, you can provide the output, and I can help confirm the correct answer!\n",

    "# Print the salary again\n",
    "print(mystery.salary)\n",
    "If the method name is different, replace give_raise with the correct method name you find from the help(mystery) output. This will adjust the salary and print the updated amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Great start! You can use help() to explore an unfamiliar object. Notice how descriptive names of attributes and methods, together with the methods' docstrings, helped you figure out class functionality even when you didn't know how it was implemented. Keep this in mind when writing your own classes!"
