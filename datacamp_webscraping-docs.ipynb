    "Your recent learnings\n",
    "When you left 10 hours ago, you worked on Importing data from the Internet, chapter 1 of the course Intermediate Importing Data in Python. Here is what you covered in your last lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned how to import data from the web into Python using the urllib.request module, specifically how to use the urlretrieve function to save a file from the web to your local computer. For example, you used urlretrieve to download a dataset of wine quality from the University of California, Irvine, saving it as 'winequality-red.csv'. You also discovered how to directly load a file from the web into a pandas DataFrame without saving it locally first, using pd.read_csv() with the file's URL as the argument. This method is efficient for quickly accessing and analyzing web-hosted datasets. Additionally, you explored importing non-flat files, such as Excel files, from the web using pd.read_excel(), learning to read in all sheets of an Excel file into a dictionary of DataFrames. This skill is particularly useful for working with complex datasets distributed across multiple sheets in a single file.\n",
