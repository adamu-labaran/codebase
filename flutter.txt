/**
 * types of widget (component): it is component in react and is more of function: however in flutter widget is class but serves same functionality to similar to component in react.
 * 1. StatelessWidget
 * 2. StatefullWidget
 * 3. InheritedWidget
 * 
 * in terms of UI related stuff there are two widget: StatelessWidget and statefulWidget

 * widget is the appearance of UI it functionality, behavior etc

 * state (data) which determine how your  widget should look like, should render, behaves
 
 * the StatelessWidget (state immutable) is a static widget in which it functionality does not change 

* while statefullWidget has a dynamic functionality it does change when event act on it (state mutable).

* @override is a method of redefining an abstract class where developer defined their own costume behavior for their app
 */

MyApp class is the main component where all the functionality can be placed then call the instances in the main.

void main(){
 // with runApp function
	runApp(MyApp())	
}

key helps flutter app to identify and differentiate between widget

flutter design standard by industry requirement
1. Material design: this design system was created by google (android)
2. Cupertino design: this design system created by app (iOS)

build(BuildContext context) => BuildContext context: this a class provided by flutter which tells where exactly building is in widget tree
and each time working on extends StatelessWidget build widget will be available. it tells the location of a particular widget in the widget tree
