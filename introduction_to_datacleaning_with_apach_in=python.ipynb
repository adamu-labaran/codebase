    "Creating a defined schema helps with data quality and import performance. As mentioned during the lesson, we'll create a simple schema to read in the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Name\n",
    "Age\n",
    "City\n",
    "The Name and City columns are StringType() and the Age column is an IntegerType().\n",

    "\n",
    "First, weâ€™ll need to import the necessary module from the pyspark.sql.types library. Then, weâ€™ll define a schema using the StructType method, which allows us to specify the structure of our DataFrame. Within this schema, weâ€™ll create three fields: name, age, and city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s how you can do it step by step:\n",

    "from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType\n",
    "AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.\n",
    "Define the schema using StructType: The StructType class represents a schemaâ€”a collection of StructField objects. Each StructField corresponds to a column in your DataFrame. In our case, we want three fields: name, age, and city. Hereâ€™s how you can define the schema:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "people_schema = StructType([\n",
    "    StructField('name', StringType(), False),  # Name column (StringType, not nullable)\n",
    "    StructField('age', IntegerType(), False),  # Age column (IntegerType, not nullable)\n",
    "    StructField('city', StringType(), False)   # City column (StringType, not nullable)\n",
    "])\n",
    "AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.\n",
    "The first argument to StructField is the column name.\n",
    "The second argument specifies the data type (e.g., StringType() for strings and IntegerType() for integers).\n",
    "The third argument (False) indicates that the field is not nullable.\n",
    "And thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve defined your schema with the appropriate data types for each column. Now you can use this schema when creating your DataFrame. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸš€\n",

    "ChatGPT\n",
    "A scatter plot is typically used to show the relationship between two numeric variables, rather than between a categorical and a numeric variable. However, if you encode the categorical variable using color, shape, or size of the points, a scatter plot can still be useful for visualizing the relationship between a categorical variable and a numeric variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",

    "\n",
    "sns.scatterplot(x='numeric_variable', y='numeric_variable_2', hue='categorical_variable', data=my_data)\n",
    "In this case, the hue argument is used to differentiate the categories of the categorical variable by color, helping to visualize how the numeric variables relate within each category.

    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "Here's how each of these plots can be used (or not used) to show the relationship between a categorical variable and a numeric variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Histogram\n",
    "Purpose: A histogram is used to display the distribution of a single numeric variable by showing the frequency of data points in continuous intervals (bins).\n",
    "Relationship with Categorical Variables: Histograms aren't typically used to show relationships between a categorical variable and a numeric variable. However, you can create separate histograms for each category to compare distributions.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.histplot(data=my_data, x='numeric_variable', hue='categorical_variable', multiple='stack')\n",
    "This shows separate histograms for each category stacked on top of each other.\n",
    "2. Bar Plot\n",
    "Purpose: A bar plot is used to display the relationship between a categorical variable and a numeric summary statistic (like the mean, sum, or count).\n",
    "Relationship with Categorical Variables: Bar plots are ideal for summarizing and comparing the central tendency (like the mean) of a numeric variable across different categories.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.barplot(x='categorical_variable', y='numeric_variable', data=my_data)\n",
    "This plot will show bars representing the average (or other specified statistic) of the numeric variable for each category.\n",
    "3. Scatter Plot\n",
    "Purpose: A scatter plot is used to show the relationship between two numeric variables by plotting individual data points.\n",
    "Relationship with Categorical Variables: While scatter plots primarily show relationships between two numeric variables, you can include a categorical variable by using different colors or shapes to represent different categories.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.scatterplot(x='numeric_variable_1', y='numeric_variable_2', hue='categorical_variable', data=my_data)\n",
    "This plot will show how the two numeric variables are related, with colors representing the categories of the categorical variable.\n",
    "4. Line Plot\n",
    "Purpose: A line plot is typically used to display data points over time or another continuous variable.\n",
    "Relationship with Categorical Variables: A line plot isn't typically used for categorical and numeric variable relationships. However, if the categorical variable represents ordered categories (e.g., time periods), a line plot can show trends in the numeric variable across these categories.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.lineplot(x='ordered_categorical_variable', y='numeric_variable', data=my_data)\n",
    "This plot is useful if you want to show how the numeric variable changes across ordered categories, like different time points.\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "Bar Plot: Best for directly comparing a numeric variable across different categories.\n",
    "Box Plot: Ideal for showing the distribution of a numeric variable across categories.\n",
    "Scatter Plot: Good for showing relationships between two numeric variables, with categories differentiated by color or shape.\n",
