    "One of the things you learned about in this chapter is that not all iterables are actual lists. A couple of examples that we looked at are strings and the use of the range() function. In this exercise, we will focus on the range() function.\n",

    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "print(i)\n",
    "Recall that range() doesn't actually create the list; instead, it creates a range object with an iterator that produces the values until it reaches the limit (in the example, until the value 4). If range() created the actual list, calling it with a value of 10100\n",
    " may not work, especially since a number as big as that may go over a regular computer's memory. The value 10100\n",
    " is actually what's called a Googol which is a 1 followed by a hundred 0s. That's a huge number!\n",

    "Your recent learnings\n",
    "When you left 11 hours ago, you worked on Bringing it all together!, chapter 3 of the course Python Toolbox. Here is what you covered in your last lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned about using Python generators for efficient data processing, specifically for streaming large datasets. Generators are a powerful feature in Python that allow for lazy evaluation, meaning they generate values only as needed, which is particularly useful when working with large amounts of data. Here's a quick recap of the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Generators: You discovered how to create a generator function, which is a function that uses the yield keyword to return data one piece at a time, rather than all at once. This method conserves memory when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming Data: You explored the concept of streaming data, where data is continuously generated and can be processed line by line. This is crucial for real-time data processing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context Managers: The lesson highlighted the use of context managers (with statement) for efficient file handling, ensuring that files are automatically closed after their suite finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing Data in Chunks: You practiced processing a large dataset in chunks, specifically, you learned to process the first 1000 rows of the World Bank's World Development Indicators dataset to count how many times each country appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator Function Example: You wrote a generator function read_large_file() that lazily reads a file line by line, which is ideal for processing large files without loading them into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a snippet of code you worked with:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define read_large_file()\n",
    "def read_large_file(file_object):\n",
    "    \"\"\"A generator function to read a large file lazily.\"\"\"\n",
    "    while True:\n",

    "        if not data:\n",
    "            break\n",
    "        yield data\n",
    "This lesson equipped you with the skills to handle large datasets efficiently, a critical ability in data science and real-world data processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the next lesson is to learn how to efficiently process and analyze large datasets in chunks using pandas, including filtering, aggregating, and visualizing data for insights."

    "\n",
    "You learned about the fundamentals of writing your own functions in Python, a crucial skill for data science. Here's a quick recap of the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Functions: You discovered how to define functions using the def keyword, followed by a function name and parentheses. For example, def square(): starts a function definition.\n",
    "Parameters and Arguments: You learned the difference between parameters (variables listed in the function definition) and arguments (values passed to the function when it is called).\n",
    "Function Body and Return Values: The body of a function is where you write the code that it executes, and you learned how to use the return keyword to send back a value to the caller. For instance, returning the square of a number with return num ** 2.\n",
    "Docstrings: You found out how to document your functions using docstrings, which are triple-quoted strings that come right after the function header. They explain what the function does.\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple function that you worked with:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the function shout\n",
    "def shout():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Print a string with three exclamation marks\"\"\"\n",

    "    # Print shout_word\n",
    "    print(shout_word)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call shout\n",
    "shout()\n",
    "This function, shout, prints a string with three exclamation marks but does not take any parameters or return a value. Through exercises, you also explored how to modify this function to accept parameters and return values, enhancing its utility.\n",
