    "That is correct! The CI/CD pipeline provides automation such that new changes can be made easily and always go through thorough automated checks.\n",

    "Deployment strategies\n",
    "While deploying the machine learning model, it is strongly recommended to test if the new model works as expected. To do this, you can use different deployment strategies.\n",

    "In this exercise, you will see different characteristics of deployment strategies (basic, shadow, and canary deployment). Your task is to match each characteristic with the appropriate deployment strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Here are the characteristics and their matching deployment strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristic: The new version of the model is deployed to all users at once, replacing the old version immediately.\n",
    "Explanation: This strategy involves a straightforward deployment where the new model completely replaces the old one without any gradual rollout.\n",
    "Shadow Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristic: The new version of the model runs alongside the old version in a non-production environment to test its performance without affecting users.\n",
    "Explanation: In this strategy, the new model processes requests and generates predictions, but these results are not served to users. It allows for comparison with the old model in real-world scenarios without impacting the live system.\n",
    "Canary Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristic: The new version of the model is deployed to a small subset of users first before a full rollout to all users.\n",
    "Explanation: This strategy gradually rolls out the new model to a small segment of users to monitor its performance and identify any issues before a full deployment.\n",
    "These strategies help ensure that new models are thoroughly tested and any potential issues are identified early before affecting all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great work! Picking the right strategy depends on concerns you might have during model deployment and helps you tackle any potential problems before they affect your business.\n",

    "\n",
    "Basic Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristic: The new version of the model is deployed to all users at once, replacing the old version immediately.\n",
    "Explanation: This strategy involves a straightforward deployment where the new model completely replaces the old one without any gradual rollout.\n",
    "Shadow Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristic: The new version of the model runs alongside the old version in a non-production environment to test its performance without affecting users.\n",
    "Explanation: In this strategy, the new model processes requests and generates predictions, but these results are not served to users. It allows for comparison with the old model in real-world scenarios without impacting the live system.\n",
    "Canary Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristic: The new version of the model is deployed to a small subset of users first before a full rollout to all users.\n",
    "Explanation: This strategy gradually rolls out the new model to a small segment of users to monitor its performance and identify any issues before a full deployment.\n",

    "Data Drift:\n",

    "Example: A retail company’s model was trained on historical sales data, but recently, the customer demographics have shifted, leading to different buying patterns that the model did not encounter before. This can result in discrepancies between the model’s predictions and the current data.\n",
    "Concept Drift:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A spam detection model was trained to identify spam emails based on patterns from a few years ago. Over time, spammers have changed their tactics and email content, making the model less effective at detecting new types of spam that weren't present in the original training data.\n",
    "Concept Drift is particularly impactful because it means the underlying patterns or relationships that the model learned from are no longer valid, requiring adjustments or retraining to maintain model accuracy.\n",
