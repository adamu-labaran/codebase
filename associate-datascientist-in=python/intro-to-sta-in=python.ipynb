    "Sure! Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics serve different purposes. Here's a brief overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the features of a dataset. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Examples include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation), and graphical representations (histograms, pie charts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics use a random sample of data taken from a population to make inferences about the population. They help you make predictions, test hypotheses, and estimate population parameters based on sample data. Examples include confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, regression analysis, and ANOVA.\n",

    "Let's look at some questions and determine whether they can be answered using descriptive or inferential statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the average age of students in a class?\n",

    "Descriptive Statistics: This question asks for a summary measure (the average) of a specific dataset (ages of students in a class).\n",
    "Is there a significant difference in test scores between two different teaching methods?\n",
    "\n",

    "What proportion of survey respondents prefer product A over product B?\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics: This question asks for a summary measure (the proportion) of a specific dataset (survey responses).\n",
    "Can we predict future sales based on past sales data?\n",

    "What is the distribution of income in a particular region?\n",

    "Solution: Smaller Sample Size\n",
    "The smaller the sample size, the higher the probability of getting a sample mean less than 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "Law of Large Numbers: As the sample size increases, the sample mean tends to converge to the population mean (which is 5 in this case).\n",
    "Extreme Values: With small sample sizes, there's a higher chance of drawing a few low numbers, which can significantly pull the sample mean down.\n",
    "Probability Distribution: The distribution of sample means becomes narrower as the sample size increases, making it less likely to fall below 4.\n",

    "To maximize the chance of winning $20, choose the smallest sample size available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the answer is 10.\n",
