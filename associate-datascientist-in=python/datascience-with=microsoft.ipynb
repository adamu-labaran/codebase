    "Throughout this learning path you explore and configure the Azure Machine Learning workspace. Learn how you can create a workspace and what you can do with it. Explore the various developer tools you can use to interact with the workspace. Configure the workspace for machine learning workloads by creating data assets and compute resources\n",

    "As a data scientist, you want to focus on training machine learning models. Ideally, you want to work with a service that gives you access to all the necessary infrastructure you need to train and deploy a model. You also want the service to allow you to track any work you do to make your model reproducible and robust.\n",
