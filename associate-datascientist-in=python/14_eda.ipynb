    "The .groupby() and .agg() functions in pandas are powerful tools for performing grouped calculations on DataFrames. Here's how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    ".groupby()\n",
    "Purpose: The .groupby() function is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria. This allows you to perform operations on each group separately.\n",
    "Usage: You specify one or more columns to group by, and pandas will create a GroupBy object, which you can then aggregate, transform, or filter.\n",
    ".agg()\n",
    "Purpose: The .agg() function is used to apply one or more aggregation operations to each group. Aggregation operations include functions like mean(), sum(), count(), min(), max(), and custom functions.\n",
    "Usage: After grouping the data, you can use .agg() to specify the aggregation functions you want to apply to each column in the group.\n",
    "Example\n",
