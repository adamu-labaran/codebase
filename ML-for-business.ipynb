    "With all the hype and new phrases being invented each day, it's easy to get lost and misuse some of the terms, adding to the already complex field of machine learning. Identify which of the statements about machine learning and data needs below are incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning can be done at any point in the data pyramid as its algorithmic power can overcome challenges with data quality.\n",
    "Possible Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling types\n",
    "There are many differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning types, and it's important to understand how each can be used in a business setting. Review the following statements about supervised and unsupervised machine learning types and identify which one is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "possible ans:\n",
    "Correct! Only supervised learning uses input features to learn patterns about how they can be used to predict the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Job role responsibilities\n",
    "In any company, it's very important to hire the right people to work on the existing data needs to make sure their skills and motivations are aligned with the company's data maturity and goals. In this exercise, you will review several data needs and business situations, and will identify which decision is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "possible ans:\n",
    "A data analyst at a manufacturing company has spotted weird outlier data points in the readings from the machine sensors. He shared the results with the leadership and their decision is to build a machine learning model right away that will identify any outliers automatically in the operating system of the manufacturing machines and send a signal to the employees operating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect! While the automated machine learning solution might eventually be the end result, the company shouldn't skip the steps of analyzing the weird outliers first, then have a data scientist apply more complex analytic methods, build prototype prediction models, test if they can identify any of the outliers before they occur, and then - if it shows promising results - identify opportunities for an automated machine learning solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference and prediction differences\n",
    "The difference between inference and prediction models is mostly in the way the business question or hypothesis is phrased. It's also important to understand the pros and cons of each. There is a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability: some models are easy to understand but do not have optimal predictions; others have excellent predictions but it's unclear how they got there. Below are several statements about the inference and prediction focused models. Select the one that is NOT correct.\n",
    "ans: Inference models are more accurate than prediction machine learning models.\n",
    "Yes, this is incorrect as it is the prediction models that are more accurate!\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have successfully identified the right type of model question for each of these use cases! This will be an important skill in framing the business questions into modeling strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments and causal models\n",
    "In the video, we have discussed the importance of experiments such as website or email A/B tests and the role they play when assessing the need of causal models. Read the statements below and identify which of these is incorrect.\n",
    "ans: Whenever possible, causal models are preferred over experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify non actionable variables\n",
    "Rosie’s machine learning team has deployed a machine learning model on an insurance company’s website. It predicts a purchase probability for a certain insurance type for each customer. Then, the customized recommended product with the highest probability for each customer is shown on the homepage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website team started running AB tests and didn't see any sales increase in the customer group with machine learned recommendation compared with the group that only has generic messages on the main website. Rosie asked to review the model, and provide insights into what are the key driving variables, and how the model was designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the inferential models, it is important to use variables which the business can affect and has impact on versus the ones that are just correlated but are not useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "What conclusion can you draw based on the most impactful variables? Select the most important one.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: The most impactful variables are highly correlated with the desired outcome (interest in a product leads to product purchase) but they are not actionable. The machine learning model needs to be rebuilt using actionable inputs that the business can impact\n",

    "Supervised modeling principles\n",
    "You have learned the fundamental principles of supervised machine learning models. Now you will read a list of several statements about supervised learning and find one that is incorrect.\n",
    "ans: Supervised machine learning uses inputs features to discover outliers.\n",
    "Correct! Outlier detection is ultimately an unsupervised machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is used to identify patterns in data, build clusters or detect outliers\n",
    "Correct! These are the most common use cases for using unsupervised machine learning.\n",
