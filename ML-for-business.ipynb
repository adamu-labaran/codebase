    "ans: A beauty products company started seeing a lower number of customers reaching their \"Gold Status\" which requires meeting certain level of annual spending and other criteria. The competition has been much more active lately. The company decided to build an ML model identifying potential \"Gold Status\" customers early after they joined the company, and giving them extra discounts, more focused customer service and other incentives. The company ran a test on half of its customers using ML prediction. The conversion rate to \"Gold Status\" has increased for all customers.\n",

    "false: Churn prediction model correctly captures 90% of all churned customers (90% recall), yet it predicts most of the non-churned customers as churned - of all the customers predicted as churned only 5% actually are churners (5% precision). The business asks the ML team to update the model to reduce the number of false positives, as the cost to run any campaigns will be very high if it has to cover almost all customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "false: A trading company is starting to use stock price prediction to make trading decisions. The percentage error rate is 25% which means on average the prediction is 25% different than the actual stock price. The traders are concerned. The company tests the model output as one of the rules in an automated rule-based trading system and sees uplift in the returns over the other non-ML rule-based trading system. Based on the positive results, the company is rolling out the prediction as one of the key signals for both the trading systems and the traders.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inference Models: These models are designed to understand relationships between variables, often focusing on causal relationships. They prioritize interpretability and understanding the underlying mechanisms or causes. Examples include linear regression and logistic regression. These models are not always the most accurate in terms of predictions because they might sacrifice some predictive power for the sake of interpretability.\n",
    "Prediction Models: These models prioritize accuracy in making predictions. They focus on providing the best possible predictions, often at the expense of interpretability. Examples include complex machine learning models like random forests, gradient boosting machines, and deep learning models. These models are typically more accurate for predictions but can be difficult to interpret and understand.\n",

    "Most Important Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key driving variables in the model are likely non-actionable, which means the business cannot leverage these variables to increase sales through targeted recommendations. To improve the effectiveness of the model, it should incorporate more actionable variables that the business can influence to drive sales.\n",
    "Next Steps:\n",
    "Review and Redesign the Model: Include more actionable variables in the model that the business can control and adjust, such as marketing spend, discount offers, and website layout.\n",

Here, you will review several model performance metrics with business conclusions and identify which statement is incorrect.\n",

    "High accuracy but low precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The model is predicting the majority class well, but it's failing to correctly identify and predict the minority class. This could lead to significant issues if the minority class is critical, such as fraud detection.\n",
    "Correct: This statement is correct as it accurately describes the scenario where a model performs well overall (high accuracy) but fails to detect important minority cases (low precision and recall).\n",
    "High precision but low recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The model is very good at predicting the positive class correctly (few false positives), but it misses many true positives (high false negatives). This might be problematic in scenarios where missing a positive case is costly, such as in medical diagnosis.\n",
    "Correct: This statement is correct. High precision but low recall means the model rarely predicts positive when it shouldn't, but often fails to predict positive when it should.\n",
    "High recall but low precision\n",

    "Reason: Production systems are typically live, customer-facing, and critical to business operations. They include systems like CRM, fraud detection, and online banking platforms, which are actively used and managed in real-time environments. A weekly business report stored as a spreadsheet is more of a static document used for periodic analysis rather than a live, interactive system.\n",

    "ML in production launch\n",
    "Deploying machine learning models into production systems is a complex task, and requires caution and close business involvement to make sure customers are not negatively affected. Releasing slowly and to a limited audience, tracking results and feedback is critical to ensure a smooth launch and early detection of any possible issues.\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "Deploying machine learning models into production systems requires a structured and careful approach to ensure smooth operation and minimal disruption to customers. Here is a typical process for launching ML models into production:\n",

    "Deploy the model to a staging environment that mimics the production environment.\n",
    "Conduct end-to-end tests to verify that the model integrates well with other systems and processes.\n",
    "Gradual Rollout:\n",
    "\n",
    "Release the model to a limited audience or a small percentage of users initially.\n",
    "Monitor performance metrics and gather feedback from this subset of users.\n",
    "Gradually increase the rollout to more users as confidence in the model’s performance grows.\n",
    "Track Results and Collect Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuously track key performance indicators (KPIs) and other metrics to evaluate the model’s impact.\n",
