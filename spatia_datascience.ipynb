    "1. Geoenrichment Explanation\n",
    "Geoenrichment involves enhancing a dataset with additional geographic and demographic information. The correct description of how geoenrichment adds demographic variables to a dataset of coffee shop locations is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoenrichment draws a polygon around the coffee shop locations and apportions the demographic variables that get assigned to each coffee shop using the underlying population.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that demographic data is assigned based on the geographic area surrounding each coffee shop, often proportionally based on the area each location covers or the population density in that area.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Engineering Task for Well Data\n",
    "To visualize well locations and their status on a map, the required data engineering tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for and correct any records that have null longitude and latitude values. This is essential for ensuring that all well locations can be accurately mapped.\n",
    "Optionally, geoenriching the spreadsheet could provide additional context but is not required for basic mapping of well locations and status.\n",
    "Pivoting the data based on the county is not necessary for mapping purposes but might be useful for analysis by county.\n",

    "3. Data Visualization Techniques\n",
    "a. Visualizing the Relationship Between Two Numeric Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The appropriate technique for visualizing the relationship between two numeric variables is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatterplot shows how two numeric variables relate to each other by plotting data points on a Cartesian plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Visualizing the Distribution of Yearly Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the distribution of yearly sales for multiple coffee shops over a period, the most effective technique is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot provides a visual summary of the distribution, showing the median, quartiles, and possible outliers, which helps in understanding the spread and central tendency of sales data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoenrichment apportions demographic data based on overlapping areas or population.\n",
    "For well data, ensure no missing location data; geoenrichment is optional but not essential for mapping.\n",
    "Scatterplots are used to show relationships between two numeric variables.\n",
    "Box plots are ideal for visualizing distributions and variations in sales data over time.\n",
