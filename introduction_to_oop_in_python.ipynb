The __init__ method allows for the initialization of an object's attributes at the time of its creation, promoting more organized and maintainable code. Here are the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding __init__: This special method is called automatically when a new object is created. It's used to assign values to the object's attributes.\n",

    "Creating Attributes: Attributes can be defined directly within the __init__ method, making the code more readable and ensuring all attributes are immediately available.\n",

    "Setting Default Values: You can set default values for attributes within the __init__ method, which are used if no specific value is provided during object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices: Naming conventions suggest using camel case for class names and underscores for methods and attributes. The self keyword is standard for referring to the object instance within methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Application: You applied these concepts by creating a Calculator class with an __init__ method that initializes two numbers and includes methods for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n",

    "  def __init__(self, num_one, num_two):\n",

    "You learned about the core concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP). Specifically, you explored how inheritance allows for a class, known as a child class, to inherit attributes and methods from another class, referred to as the parent class. This minimizes code reuse and extends functionality. For example, a SavingsAccount class inherits from a BankAccount class, gaining all its functionalities and adding new ones like an interest rate and a method to compute interest.\n",

    "Key points covered include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a child class constructor that calls the parent class's constructor using ParentClass.__init__(self, args), allowing the child class to inherit the parent's attributes and methods.\n",
    "Adding new attributes and methods to the child class that are specific to its functionality, such as an interest_rate attribute and a compute_interest method for SavingsAccount.\n",
    "Overriding methods in the child class to customize or extend the behavior of inherited methods, demonstrated with the give_raise method in the Manager class, which adds a bonus feature to the salary increase functionality inherited from the Employee class.\n",
